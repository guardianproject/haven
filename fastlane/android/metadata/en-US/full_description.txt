Haven is for people who need a way to protect their personal spaces
and possessions without compromising their own privacy. It is an
Android application that leverages on-device sensors to provide
monitoring and protection of physical spaces. Haven turns any Android
phone into a motion, sound, vibration and light detector, watching for
unexpected guests and unwanted intruders. We designed Haven for
investigative journalists, human rights defenders, and people at risk
of forced disappearance to create a new kind of herd immunity. By
combining the array of sensors found in any smartphone, with the
world’s most secure communications technologies, like Signal and Tor,
Haven prevents the worst kind of people from silencing citizens
without getting caught in the act.

Project Team

Haven was developed through a collaboration between Freedom of the
Press Foundation and Guardian Project. Prototype funding was
generously provided by FPF, and donations to support continuing work
can be contributed through their site:

Safety through Sensors

Haven only saves images and sound when triggered by motion or volume,
and stores everything locally on the device. You can position the
device’s camera to capture visible motion, or set your phone somewhere
discreet to just listen for noises. Get secure notifications of
intrusion events instantly and access the logs remotely or anytime
later.

The follow sensors are monitored for a measurable change, and then
recorded to an event log on the device:

* Accelerometer: phone’s motion and vibration
* Camera: motion in the phone’s visible surroundings from front or back camera
* Microphone: noises in the environment
* Light: change in light from ambient light sensor
* Power: detect device being unplugged or power loss
